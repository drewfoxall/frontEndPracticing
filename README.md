About this project
---------------------------------------------------------------
I have just graduated with a BA in Information technology, I want to set out and give myself the goal of improving my full stack development, and doing so in portions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My goal for this project will be to create a website in which a user can log in and create a commander deck for the card game Magic the Gathering.
I want the user to be able to search for cards, and create 100 card decks using the cards, and then save the deck.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository will focus on  front end development using Typescript and the React framework
